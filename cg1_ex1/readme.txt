Enclosed you will find all files necessary for assignment 1
of computer graphics 1 (CG 1). you will need GLUT to compile
the code and run the binary. GLUT is available for both win32
and linux and macosx platforms from

http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html (win32)

and

http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/index.html


This zip archive contains the Visual Studio workspace 
and project files and also Linux and Mac makefiles. 
Simple type 'make -f Makefile.linux' in a Linux console 
to compile with g++. To compile on a Mac simple type 
'make -f Makefile.macosx' in the Terminal 

To get an idea of what a possible solution could look like, 
try the enclosed binaries in the 'win32' / 'linux' / 'macosx'
subdirectories.

For the five cg1 assignment demos there will be a windows 7 pc 
and an ubuntu pc available in my office, but it has proven to be 
more "stable" to bring own laptop computers.

I would strongly urge all participants to use C/C++ 
throughout this course. I am aware of (and use) jogl for Java, 
but the code skeletons I will provide for cg1 are all C/C++
*only*. You are allowed to use Java/jogl, but be aware that
you will need to port the skeleton code for all assignments. 
Warning: the skeleton code for cg1_ex2 is very large.

Finally, any questions concering the code and/or assignment 
should be directed to
